prototype-cc
============

Web command-center style interface for Prototyper application.

I'll almost certainly need to revamp with Node.js to be able to create a proper socket.

Brief Notes:
 - RTSP Client version of phone, though functional seems more difficult to work over local network and generally more troublesome despite easier setup.

 Technologies to look at:
 	- screen, cron commands
 	- MeteorJS
 	- ForeverJS
 	- Apache?

 Updates:
 5/28/2014: set up a basic chat history and recenter the map every 5 seconds. Want to drop a pin at some point on the user's location, trace their path (?), and set up a proper chat history (scrolling).
